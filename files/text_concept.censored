Please include business justification, name of sender and name of recipient(s). We will review the email you are requesting and release it to you once we have determined it is virus free. In addition to being cautious regarding email please remember to do the following as mentioned in █████████████ Y2K email on ██████████████████ Log off. For most users, follow normal procedures and choose "Close all programs and log on as a different user" when leaving for the night. Leave PC turned on. Following these procedures will allow the Infrastructure & Integration team to download virus patches to your PCs over ██████████████████████.
