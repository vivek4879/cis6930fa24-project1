    Entity: That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companies from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money., Start: 158, End: 293
    Entity: That's because investors bought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock tanked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting., Start: 418, End: 571
